# Wishing Well - The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up
The Wishing Well is a front-end application that allows the user to rant about their day, or offer compliments to those who have already ranted about theirs. Proud recipent of an Honourable Mention for the Hackital hackathon (Novemeber 12, 2017). In this application, we have included:

-REST methods for posting and getting both compliments and rants

-An aestheticaly pleasing UI with the help of Bootstrap.

For later editions, we hope to:

-Improve the usability using an application such as AJAX

-Improve the user experience by having more interactive components
